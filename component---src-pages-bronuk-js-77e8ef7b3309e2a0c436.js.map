There, we met and \r\n          connected with a special person who inspired us to start working \r\n          together. Since then we are deeply connected with Nepal, a poor \r\n          country with an unprecedented spiritual wealth.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n          In 2000, Premangee, a young Nepali humanitarian and conservationist, \r\n          planted the first seed with the intention of helping all life on earth. \r\n          The seed was patiently watered with love and compassion and blossomed \r\n          into a series of projects which are now successfully operating in Nepal: \r\n          a school which was rebuild after the 2015 earthquakes supporting more than \r\n          300 children, a womenâ€™s program to learn about motherhood and the feminine \r\n          qualities, an international communal home, a retreat centre, a biodynamic \r\n          farm, and now we are supporting the building of an Ayurvedic laboratory.\r\n          </p> \r\n<p>Since 2000, many people from different countries got into contact with Premangee \r\n    and he inspired us to initiate new projects in our respective countries. Now we \r\n    have founded AVA in Germany, We Are One in Spain, Divine Breath Foundation in \r\n    Australia and Aikyam in the Netherlands. While we each work in our own countries \r\n    we work together as well.\r\n</p>\r\n       </div>\r\n        </Layout>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
