The first years were not an easy period. I was mostly fighting with myself and against injustice, at least from my perspective, bumping into many walls. At the same time there was the search for a natural, simple existence and a different way of living together in harmony with everything and everyone. Because of this I started to learn more about shamanism, again different movements and traditions."),n.createElement("p",null,"A few years ago I came into contact with Guru Premangee from Nepal and have since been connected with the organization he founded. His life lessons resonate deeply within me. The simplicity, but at the same time depth of the directions feel like coming home. Connected with the earth, with the elements and all life forms. Where the focus is on the positive flow with great trust, where there is a place for everyone regardless of background or beliefs. I therefore love to work through Aikyam to get these ideas rooted in the Netherlands as well.")))}}}]);
